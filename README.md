# TwitterStocks
Small side project continuing work from my cs196 final project

Short Term Goal: Write linear regression essay on the correlation of tweets to stocks, assuming one exists.

 Steps:

  1. Write twitter sentiment puller
  2. Find efficient way to store data
  3. Collect sentiment and stock data
  4. Run regression in excel

Long Term Goal: Create a bot to trade (paper) stocks, assuming that it wouldn't obviously lose money. If the above turns out to be a failure, there are more efficient ways of trading stocks.
